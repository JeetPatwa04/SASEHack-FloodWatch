## Flood Forecasting with ML: Project Overview

Here is our deployed website: https://floodwatchsasehack.vercel.app/

### Concept:
A full-stack web app that uses machine learning to predict how high rivers will get over the next few days
Built entirely on free, real-time public data

### How It Works:
Pulls live and historical streamflow readings from USGS gauges
Combines them with rainfall observations and forecasts
The model learns how upstream conditions and incoming rain drive downstream water levels

### Predictions:
Forecasts river level or discharge 6 to 72 hours ahead for each gauge
Includes an uncertainty range with every prediction
Converts predictions into the chance of reaching official flood stages (minor, moderate, major)

### Benchmarking:
Compares our model against the National Weather Service's official forecasts
Also compares against the National Water Model
Lets users see how our predictions stack up in the same view

### Tech Stack:
Data ingestion: scheduled pipeline pulling from USGS, NWS, and weather sources
Model service: trains and serves the forecasting model
API: connects the model and data to the front end
Front end: interactive map and dashboard where users pick a gauge and see observed levels, our forecast, the official forecast, and flood risk together

### Design and UX:
Clean, calming, easy to use!

### Data Sources:
USGS Water Data API: observed streamflow and gauge height
NWPS API: official forecasts and flood thresholds
National Water Model: historical and forecast streamflow
Open-Meteo: historical and forecast rainfall
